A basic introductory tutorial for [SQL](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/) using Python's sqlite3 module.

Written tutorial comming soon...

The tutorial is also inside of the code.

I am trying to make this easy to grasp, so more will come gradually. 
I will show how to save sql databases as .sql and also how to save it to .csv format. 

Resources I am using to learn SQL for this tutorial are:
- http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/introduction.html
- An open source databse [browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org) for SQLite. This is good for testing the SQL files you create in python.
