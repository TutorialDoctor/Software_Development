I spend most of my time learning new things, and sometimes I teach them. 

There are two types of information in the world. There is good information and there is bad information. Misguided information is bad information also. 

Not only should you avoid bad information at all costs (certainly don't start a religion with it), but you really have to be sober minded when learning anything. 

What I mean by sober minded is that you have to not follow everything you hear even if it seems right. 

I have found that information is easy to find. Good information that is easy to understand and actually useful is much harder to find. 

It is definitely good to have a mentor. When times get hard, someone who is higher than you and more sober than you can guide you on the right path. 

We tackle these paths blindly at times, searching for that light at the end of the tunnel. Hopefully that light is good light. 

Don't just learn. Learn good (and yes I mean good).
