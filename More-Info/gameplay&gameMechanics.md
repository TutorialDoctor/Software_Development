# O.O.R.W.E.D.O

When you make a game, you want it to be fun to play. You also want it to have replay value. I have creaed a simple procedure for figuring out the gameplay and game mechanics of your game. We will remember this procedure with the acronym "OORWEDO" (sounds like "or we do").

- Objective
- Obstacles
- Reward
- Weaknesses
- Exploitation
- Defense
- Offense

# OOR
Give the player a clear **objective**/goal with **obstacles** to prevent them from getting to the goal. **Reward** the player for overcoming those obstacles and getting to the goal.

- Objective
    - How do you win? 
    - Where are you trying to get to? 

- Obstacles
    - Enemies (visible or invisible)
    - Traps
    - Gameplay features
    - Mechanics
    - Limited supplies
    - Level design

- Reward
   - Points
   - Experience points (XP)
   - A new level
   - A new character
   - More power

# WE-DO
 Now considering the player's *options*, the player should be given **weaknesses to exploit** in the obstacles as well as **defense** and **offense** mechanisms against these obstacles.

- Weaknesses and Exploitation
    - Enemies can't see you in shadows so stay in the shadows
    - If you time it right, you can run pass the traps
    - The big boss weak point is the eye

- Defense and Offense
    - Use your shield and sword to fight the enemies and move in the shadows
    - The level is dark, so your flashlight will help you navigate the level better

**Note**: missing "Penalty." There has to be some sort of penalty for not reaching the objectives
