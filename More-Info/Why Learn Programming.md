# Facts
**A computer is a tool** that can make your life easier, like any other tool.

- No matter what field you go into, you can use a computer program to make your job easier.
- The first computers helped people add and subtract faster, but now they can do a lot more than that.

## Why learn programming?
<hr>
Because it can really change your life!

 - If you want to make a lot of **money, fast**, learn to program.
 - A program can do your **homework** for you.
 - You can make your dream **video game**.
 - You can program a robot to do your **chores** 
 - You can create a program that **saves lives**
 - You can create a program to send a person to ~~the moon. Wait, we've done that enough already~~ neptune and back.
 
 
## How much money can you make?
<hr>
A popular incentive for learning to program is the **payout**. You type on a keyboard for a few hours, and suddenly you are raking in **50,000 a day**.

- Flappybird made $50,000 from ads because Pewdie Pie liked it. So the key is to get Pewdie Pie to like it, or some other celebrity.
- Ebay started out of the home of a stay-at-home mom. Now she is raking in the dough like a cake factory.
- I was given 400 dollars for making a program that took about an hour to make. At my "real job" I hardly made that in two weeks.
- The top jobs in IT(Information Technology) right now make upwards of $80,000 a year. You can pretty much skip college for that!


## Other reasons?
<hr>
A computer is like a robot where your will is its command. In fact, a robot IS a computer. Think of the possibilities!

- **Robots** can now do medical procedures, vacuum your carpet, drive cars fly aircraft, and have a conversation with you.
- But its all about the **homework** and the **money** right?


## Why should you pay attention in school?
<hr>
### Video games, duh !
- I wasn't a big fan of school myself, but thankfully I paid enough attention in school. I can now use what I learned to make video games!
- The reason school gets so boring is because too much time is spent learning the boring stuff, and not enough time is spent actually using it for something useful in day to day life.
- The more stuff you know (all school subjects matter) the more stuff you will be able to do.
- Video games are the ultimate medium, because they encompass knowledge of all school subjects. Math, social studies, language arts, and science can all be used in the creation and deployment of a video game.
- You don't need to know a lot of math or science to make videos games these days, because you use a game engine most of the time.
- But, if you want to make some custom type of game, you will probably need to know how to do math anyway, so pay attention anyhow. Remember, the more you know, the more you can do.

### Help people
- My incentive for learning to program is to help people. If I took any class related to the human body, like biology or anatomy, I could use that information to write a program or game that literally helps people.
- I could program a robot to help people even.
- I could help students learn their school subjects faster and better.

### Because you can seem smarter than everyone else
- Programmers are about 99% lazy and 1% smart. And that is why we do it!
- Programming isn't hard, and you don't have to be a genius to do it. The big time programmers probably are smart, but I am sure they are more lazy than they are smart. 
- So, if you want to work less, get paid a bunch, and seem smart, pay attention in school and learn to program. 

## College?
<hr>
- You don't need college to learn this stuff. This is confirmed by some of the biggest names in technology. Youtube is your friend.
- HOWEVER, the more you know, the more you can do, and college is a good place to learn stuff you didn't know. 
- College is also a way to meet people that are interested in the same things you are. Not everyone will learn to program, or want to make $50,000 a day, but in college, you might find some who are interested.
- You will have to do the math yourself to see if college is worth that investment.
