Understanding model view controllers was a pain for me. I have found a few resources:

- [Model-View-Controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwwznm9XSME) Video
- [MVC explained](https://realpython.com/blog/python/the-model-view-controller-mvc-paradigm-summarized-with-legos/)
- [Understanding MVC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTdVkgF_Slo)Video
