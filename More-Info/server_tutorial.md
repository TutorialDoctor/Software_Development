# What is a Server?

Tutorial coming...


Notes:
<strike>

You’re sitting at a restaurant and you are ready to eat.

A server comes to the table and asks you what you want to eat.

You request some food, the server responds to that request by sending it to the cooks. The cooks retrieve the ingredients they need for your request and assemble them for you (they cook your food) and give it to the server. Then the server gives it to you.

> “In a technical sense, a server is an instance of a computer program that accepts and responds to requests made by another computer program; know as the client. Less formally, any device that runs server software could be considered as a server as well. Servers are used to mange network resources.”


The customer is the client, the server is the server. The airway through which you communicate is the network. Servers can access databases (storehouses) and serve that information to you.

Google’s servers get requests all of the time.

As you can imagine, a server can receive requests from several clients at the same time. Servers are also responsible for managing these requests.

The best servers serve fast and accurately, but of course sometimes information gets lost along the way.

Slow networks may cause slow serving. The faster the network, the faster the service.

A web server serves web content like HTML, CSS and Javascript.

A media server serves media like pictures and movies.

There are game servers and database servers and file servers and mail servers and print servers and web servers and application servers.


If a program is a recipe and a database is a storehouse for data, servers take one recipe request, perhaps accesses a database to retrieve the data needed, and serves the actual receive to the client.

One type of request you may have heard of is an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request.

HTTP is a set of rules for transferring text. Basically it is the “How” in how to request something from a server.

Follow the rules or you will get a “HTTP Error 400 Bad request” error message.

Another type of request is an HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secured) request.

This is an encrypted (secure/private) request. Sometimes you don’t want everyone to know what you are getting.


[Another definition](http://techterms.com/definition/server) says that a servers is a computer that provides data to another computer.

It may serve data to systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the internet. On a LAN network, data is typically served from one computer to another via an Ethernet cable. 

Facebook serves billions of clients a day. The server that is Facebook is one serious computer.

Client-server systems follow a request-response model. A client sends a request to the server and eventually gets a response back - a result.
