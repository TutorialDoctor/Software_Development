## Notes from research
 
- A **database** is a structured **set of data** stored in a computer 
- To **query** is to seek or ask. It is a precise **request for information** from a database. When you enter text into **Google's search** field, you are entering a query (a precise request for information)  from Google's database. This is called a "**web search query**."
- A **Query language** is a computer language **used to make queries** into databases and information systems
- **SQL** is a **Structured Query Language**  for database manipulation. It is a structured language used to request precise information from a database. 
- DBMS (Database Management  System)
-  Relational database - a database structured to recognize relations among stored items of information. tables rows columns.

- store clerks = database management system 
- store warehouse  = database 
- aisles = tables (snacks)
- shelf columns = fields?
- rows = rows/records 
- customer question and clerk retrieval = query (do you have.. can you stock ...)

## Tutorial (WIP)
A **database** is like a store or **warehouse** where things are stored.Every store/warehouse usually stores their things in a relational sort of way. The housewares section of the store stores things related to "things in a house." The grocery section of the store/warehouse stores things related to "editable items." A database where things are related to other things is called a **Relational Database**.

If the database is the store, the **staff** is the **Database Management System** (DBMS). The staff manages the database by adding to, taking from, and updating the things in the database.

**SQL** is a relational database that stores data in tables. Tables are like the shelf columns in a store.


## Example
- database : Walmart
- table : Fruit
- record : banana = [PLU #4011,name banana, pricePerPound €12]
- customer query = "do you have a regular banana cheaper than €12?"
- boss query = "switch those apples out for melons. the season is changing."

the customer is requesting an item from the database.
your boss is requesting a change or update in the database.

The question mark is usually used to denote a query (question).

PLU = price lookup code. stored in a PLU database

Your brain has a relational database in it. This is why I use analogies, so that you can relate the topic I am explaining to a table that is already in your brain database. Now cooking and programming are related in your relational database.

Now lets [make something cool!]()
