## Tutorial (WIP)
A **database** is like a store or **warehouse** where things are stored. Every store/warehouse usually stores their things in a relational sort of way. The Housewares section of the store stores things related to "things in a house." The grocery section of the store/warehouse stores things related to "editable items." A database where things are related to other things is called a **Relational Database**.

If the database is the store, the **staff** is the **Database Management System** (DBMS). The staff manages the database by adding to, taking from, and updating the things in the database.

A relational database is a database that stores data in tables. Tables are like the shelf columns in a store, or like tables in an outdoor marketplace. One table might store fruit for sell, while another might store birds for sell. Each fruit or bird in/on the table is a **record** and have similar but different properties to the other records in/on the table. Each **property** is called a **field** in an sqlite database.

A customer walks into the store and says, "Will you get me a regular banana that is cheaper than $2.00?" The customer has just made a **query** - a **precise request** for data - to **retrieve** data from a database.

Another customer says, "Please stock this item for my next visit." This customer has just made a query for data to be **inserted** into the database.

If your boss walked up to you and told you to, "Switch those apples out for melons, the season is changing," then that would be a query too, and it is a request to **update** data in the database.

To clarify, when you enter text into Google's search field, you are entering a query (a precise request for data) from Google's database. You have entered a "**web search query**."

## Example
<pre>
Database : Walmart
Table : Fruit
Record : banana = [PLU #4011,name banana, pricePerPound €12]

Customer query : "Do you have a regular banana cheaper than €12?"

Boss query = "Switch those apples out for melons, the season is changing."

The customer is requesting an item from the database.
Your boss is requesting a change or update in the database.
</pre>

***Note:*** a PLU is a **price lookup code** and is stored in a [PLU database](http://supermarketpage.com/prucodes.php)

And another [list of PLU codes](https://quizlet.com/12154470/common-produce-plu-codes-flash-cards/).

Your brain has a relational database in it. This is why I use analogies, so that you can relate the topic I am explaining to a table that is already in your brain database. Now cooking and programming are related in your relational database.

## Notes from research
<strike style=color:red>
- A **database** is a structured **set of data** stored in a computer 
- To **query** is to seek or ask. It is a precise **request for information** from a database. When you enter text into **Google's search** field, you are entering a query (a precise request for information)  from Google's database. This is called a "**web search query**."
- A **Query language** is a computer language **used to make queries** into databases and information systems
- **SQL** is a **Structured Query Language**  for database manipulation. It is a structured language used to request precise information from a database. 
- DBMS (Database Management  System)
- Relational database - a database structured to recognize relations among stored items of information. tables rows columns.
- The question mark is usually used to denote a query (question).

- store clerks = database management system 
- store warehouse  = database 
- aisles = tables (snacks)
- shelf columns = fields?
- rows = rows/records 
- customer question and clerk retrieval = query (do you have.. can you stock ...)</strike>
