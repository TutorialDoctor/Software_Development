# Three Key Facets
___

There are three key facets recur in math, science, art, social studies, language arts, sports, and other subjects.

# Point, Line, Shape, Circle

### Point Basics
A point is a point or location.
Points have a **location**.

### Line Basics
A line is two points connected.
Lines have a **length**, an **angle**, and a **direction**.
 

### Shape Basics
A shape is three or more points connected by lines. Shapes have an **area** and a **circumference**. 

A **circle** is a set of all points that are equally distant from a single point. 

## Point

A point can exist on a 2D plane, as well as in 3D space. 

A 2D point has an x component and a y component. **2 components** describe its location

A 3D point has x, y, and z components. **3 components** describe its location

## Line

A line can exist on a 2D plane as well as in 3D space.

A 3D line (also called a **vector**) has a length (**magnitude**), and a direction . It has an angle also (I will note the difference between direction and angle).

Ex. "*30 degrees West*"

Both points of a 3D line each have x, y, and z components.

Lines theoretically continue forever in both directions. A **line segment** (part of a line) has two endpoints. A **ray** is also part of a line that has one endpoint and continues in the other direction forever.

The **slope** of a line is the slant or tilt of the line. It is given by the amount the line rises divided by the amount the line runs. 

## Shape

A shape can exist on a 2D plane, as well as in 3D space.

A shape has an **area** (the amount of 2d space it takes up) and a **perimeter**(boundary) which is calculated as length of all the sides combined.

A 2D shape can exist in 3D space. 

Primitive 2D shapes are:

- triangle
- rectangle & cube
- circle

A **polygon** is figure with at least three sides.


The perimeter of a circle is called the **circumference**

## 3D Shapes
There are corresponding 3D shapes for the primitive 2D shapes.

- Triangle >> Pyramid
- Square >> Cube
- Circle >> Sphere

3D shapes such as the above have a **volume** (amount of 3D space it takes up) and a **surface area**.

- Volume >> area
- Surface area >> perimeter

# Information

These three key facets recur in math, science, art, social studies, language arts, sports, and other subjects. 

- The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
- A curve is a series of connected lines that gradually decrease or increase in slope.
- Lattitude and longitude are points on the globe that describe a location.
- Being able to **draw** a point, line, and shape are the basic skills needed to be able to draw.
- "*Get straight to the point!*"
	- Get to a location in your brain. 
- "*What point are you trying to make*"
- Two lines that intersect intersect at exactly one point
- A compass tells you the direction you are headed.
- **Gravity** is a vector. It has a length/magnitude and a direction.
- Raycast
- To "**normalize**" a vector means to **scale** the magnitude of the vector down, so that it is pro proportional to a vector of length 1 (or another value).
- The **trajectory** (path) of a shot bullet is a parabola.
- "Secure the perimeter!"
	- Secure the boundary
