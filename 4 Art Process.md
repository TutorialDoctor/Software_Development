# Game Development Process (Rough Draft)

# The Summarized Process
The main process for creating any product is:

- Describe
- Prototype
- Refine
- Polish
- Package

First, describe the product. The better the description, the easier it is to **stay true** to the idea. Create a prototype **Don't deviate** from the working prototype. Refine the product. Refining is the longest stage (**tweaking**). Polish the product. The polish stage shouldn't add new features, but **enhance** existing ones. Package your product in an **easy to access and use** way (consider this in the beginning).

## The Art Process
___

- Point
- Line
- Shape
- Color
- Shade

A **point** describes a **location.** A **line** describes an **angle** and a **length**. A **shape** describes an **area** (the amount of space the object takes up) and a **perimeter** (the boundary of the shape). Color describes a color (it also conveys a mood). **Shade** describes a **change in color.**

The two most basic skills you should master is to be able to draw a **perfect line** (from any angle) and a **perfect circle**, at any size. Additionally, practice drawing primitive shapes several times, exactly the same. Practice!

**Curves are lines**. **Don't draw curves** (hard and usually inaccurate), draw straight lines (easy and accurate). You can modify them if you need to later (draw lightly at first).

### 2D Art Process
1. **Sketch** (Describe)
2. **Composition** (Prototype)
3. **Silhouetting** (Refine)
4. **Color** (Polish)
5. **Shading** (Polish)
6. **Details** (Polish)

Sketch the idea first. Compose the image using primitive shapes (square, triangle, circle). Refine the primitive shapes to get an accurate silhouette. Give a base color to the silhouette (usually the mid-tone). Add shapes for the highlights and shadows. Shade/blend between the mid-tones, highlights and shadows. Lastly, add details. Add only the information you need to convey the image. Nothing more!

### 3D Art Process
- **Sketch** (Describe)
- **Primitive modeling** (Prototype)
- **Meshing** (Refine)
- **Materials & Textures** (Polish)
- **Rigging and Animation** (Polish)
- **Lighting** (Polish)
- **Rendering** (Polish)

Sketch the idea first (or find **reference photos**). Compose the model using **primitive shapes** (cube, pyramid, cylinder, sphere). **Refine** the primitive shapes to get an accurate mesh. **UV unwrap** the mesh. Give a **base color** (diffuse color) to the mesh (usually the mid-tone).  Create the **materials and textures**. **Rig and animate** the mesh. **Light** the model. **Render** the model. **Post-processing** (optional). Add only the information you need to convey the model. Nothing more! Too much detail, if it is the wrong detail, is bad.

### Animation
-  **Sketch** (Describe)
- **Blocking & Keyframes** (no interpolation) (Prototype)
- **Breakdown** Poses (Refine)
- **Secondary** Poses (Refine)
- **Animation Principles** (Polish)
- **Dope sheet** and spline **graph editing** (Polish)
- **Lighting, Cameras, Rendering** (Polish)

### Realism?
If you want realism, just be more **accurate**.

- **Points** (location)
- **Lines** (location,angle,length)
- **Shape** (location,size,angles)
- **Color** (hue,saturation,brightness)
- **Shading** (tint,shade,tone)
  
  Same applies for 3d models (accuracy).
