## The Code/Development Process
___
My general process for programming software is:

- **Description**
- **Pseudocode** (Prototype)
- **Real Code** (Refine)
- **Api**, libraries, and custom functions (Refine)
- **Cleanup** (Polish)
- **Compile & Ship** (Package)

First, I write a **description** of what I want the program to do in English. 

Next, I note all **nouns** in the description (usually nouns can be translated to **variables**) and write them down, taking note of their **data type**. 

I then note all of the **verbs** in the description (verbs end up being **functions**) and write them down. Now, I create/declare the nouns (as variables). 

Then I sift through the **API** to see if I can find any functions or additional variables that do what I need. If not, I will have to either make a custom function, or search **google** for it. 

Lastly, I use conditional statements, loops, and classes (if necessary), to **write the program**. 

For complicated tasks, or for more efficient programs, you could try searching for **libraries/modules** online, and import them for your own use.

Note: Throughout the process  I use the **print** function to test stuff.
