# Software Development
This repository serves as an introduction to software/game development.
It uses [Python](https://www.python.org) as a learning language, the [Brackets](http://brackets.io) editor for learning web development, and the [Godot](http://www.godotengine.org/wp/) game engine.

It is divided into 6 sections:

- [Learn](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Software_Development/blob/master/1%20Learn.md)
- [Play](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Software_Development/blob/master/2%20Play.md)
- [Resources](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Software_Development/blob/master/3%20Resources.md)
- [The Art Process](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Software_Development/blob/master/4%20Art%20Process.md)
- [The Code Process](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Software_Development/blob/master/5%20Code%20Process.md)
- [Create](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Software_Development/blob/master/6%20Create.md)

First you will **learn** how to program using the **Python** (version **2.7**) language. Then you will **play** with various programs. Next you get links to **resources**. Lastly you **create** [video **games**](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/TD-Godot-Games) using the Godot game engine API, a [**website**](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Software_Development/tree/master/WebDev%20Tutorial) using html, css, and javascript, and a few [**databases**](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Software_Development/tree/master/SQL-Tutorial) using **sqlite3** and Python.

## Notes
- This is intended for beginners who want to dive into the software development industry.

- For an easy start, you can use the [Brackets IDE](http://brackets.io) to practice Python. There is an extenssion that allows you to run Python and Ruby scripts. To download, go to File/Extension Manager within Brackets and search "Python."
The link to the repository for the extension is [here](https://github.com/jadbox/brackets-integrated-development). As a note, this extension cannot use the raw_input() and input() functions.

- This is a work in progress. Hope it helps.
