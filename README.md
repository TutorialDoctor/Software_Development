# Software_Development
This repository serves as an introduction to software/game development.
It uses [Python](https://www.python.org) as a learning language, and the [Godot](http://www.godotengine.org/wp/) game engine.

It is divided into 4 sections:
Learn
Play
Resources
Create

First you will learn how to program. Then you will play with various programs. Next you get links to resources. Lastly you create a video game using the Godot game engine API.

This is intended for beginners who want to dive into the software development industry.

Hope it helps.
