# Software_Development
This repository serves as an introduction to software/game development.
It uses [Python](https://www.python.org) as a learning language, the [Brackets](http://brackets.io) editor for learning web development, and the [Godot](http://www.godotengine.org/wp/) game engine.

It is divided into 4 sections:

- Learn
- Play
- Resources
- Create

First you will **learn** how to program using the **Python** (version **2.7**)language. Then you will **play** with various programs. Next you get links to **resources**. Lastly you **create** a video game using the Godot game engine API.

This is intended for beginners who want to dive into the software development industry.

This is a a work in progress. Hope it helps.

I will be adding Python 3 compatability.
