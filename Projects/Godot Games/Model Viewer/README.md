- Get and set properties of one node to another (colors and values)
- Manipulate a node using UI controls
- Make a camera look at a node
- And more to come!

- Mary Blass model from a free 3d model website
- Godot Engine

Notes:
It will work with animated 3d models, since all you are doing is changing the diffuse parameter of a particular mesh object.
